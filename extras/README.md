# Extras

This directory is designated for containing additional submodules for the
project which build upon the main component(s). This may include submodules
that are not part of the project’s "default" build, or otherwise impose special
requirements to be used.

For example, the following might be candidates for this directory rather than
regular components:

* "Language bindings" or extra libraries that provide integrations of the
  project with programming languages or runtimes different from its own.

* "Platform bindings" or extra libraries (plugins) that integrate the project
  with a particular platform.

* "Contributed" submodules. Additional submodules that are contributed by the
  project’s users and included in upstream, but are not officially supported
  by the project.

* Optional submodules that require additional dependencies, or may be
  prohibitive to include for all users.
